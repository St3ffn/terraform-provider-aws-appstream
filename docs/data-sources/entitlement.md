# awsappstream_entitlement (Data Source)

Reads an AppStream entitlement within a specific AppStream stack. An entitlement defines a single attribute rule that controls which users can see and launch applications from the stack. This data source can be used to reference entitlements that are managed outside of Terraform.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "awsappstream_entitlement" "example" {
  stack_name = "example-stack"
  name       = "example-name"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the entitlement within the stack.
- `stack_name` (String) The name of the AppStream stack in which the entitlement is defined.

### Read-Only

- `app_visibility` (String) Controls which applications are visible to users who match the entitlement attributes. Valid values are `ALL` or `ASSOCIATED`.
- `attributes` (Attributes Set) The attribute rule used to match federated user attributes (AWS IAM SAML PrincipalTag). Each entitlement supports **exactly one** attribute. To apply multiple rules, multiple entitlements must be created. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--attributes))
- `created_time` (String) The timestamp when the entitlement was created, in RFC 3339 format (for example, `2024-01-09T14:32:11Z`).
- `description` (String) The entitlement description, if set.
- `id` (String) A synthetic identifier for the entitlement, composed of the stack name and entitlement name in the format `<stack_name>|<name>`.

### Nested Schema for `attributes`

Read-Only:

- `name` (String) A supported AWS IAM SAML PrincipalTag attribute name. Valid values are: `roles`, `department`, `organization`, `groups`, `title`, `costCenter`, `userType`.
- `value` (String) The value of the selected attribute name that must match the federated user session.
