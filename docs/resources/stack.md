# awsappstream_stack (Resource)

Manages an AppStream stack. A stack defines the streaming configuration and user experience for AppStream sessions, including storage, networking, user actions, and application settings persistence.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# minimal resource
resource "awsappstream_stack" "example" {
  name = "example-stack"
}
```

```terraform
# full resource
resource "awsappstream_stack" "example" {
  name         = "example-stack"
  display_name = "Example AppStream Stack"
  description  = "Example AppStream stack managed by Terraform."

  redirect_url = "https://example.com/logout"
  feedback_url = "https://example.com/feedback"

  storage_connectors = [
    {
      connector_type = "HOMEFOLDERS"
    },
    {
      connector_type                = "ONE_DRIVE"
      domains                       = ["example.com"]
      domains_require_admin_consent = ["example.com"]
    }
  ]

  user_settings = [
    {
      action     = "FILE_UPLOAD"
      permission = "ENABLED"
    },
    {
      action         = "CLIPBOARD_COPY_TO_LOCAL_DEVICE"
      permission     = "ENABLED"
      maximum_length = 1048576
    }
  ]

  application_settings = {
    enabled        = true
    settings_group = "example-settings"
  }

  access_endpoints = [
    {
      endpoint_type = "STREAMING"
      vpce_id       = "vpce-0abc123def4567890"
    }
  ]

  embed_host_domains = [
    "apps.example.com",
    "portal.example.com"
  ]

  streaming_experience_settings = {
    preferred_protocol = "TCP"
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Project     = "appstream"
    Owner       = "platform-team"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the AppStream stack. Changing this value forces the stack to be replaced.

### Optional

- `access_endpoints` (Attributes Set) Interface VPC endpoints through which users can connect to the stack. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_endpoints))
- `application_settings` (Attributes) Controls persistence of application settings for users of the stack. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--application_settings))
- `description` (String) The stack description, if set. Must be 256 characters or fewer.
- `display_name` (String) The name displayed to users in the AppStream user interface.
- `embed_host_domains` (Set of String) Domains where streaming sessions can be embedded in an iframe.
- `feedback_url` (String) The URL users are redirected to after clicking the **Send Feedback** link.
- `redirect_url` (String) The URL users are redirected to after their AppStream streaming session ends.
- `storage_connectors` (Attributes Set) Storage connectors that enable persistent storage for users of the stack. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--storage_connectors))
- `streaming_experience_settings` (Attributes) Controls the preferred streaming protocol for the stack. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--streaming_experience_settings))
- `tags` (Map of String) A map of tags assigned to the AppStream stack.
- `user_settings` (Attributes Set) Actions that are enabled or disabled for users during streaming sessions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--user_settings))

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AppStream stack.
- `created_time` (String) The timestamp when the stack was created, in RFC 3339 format.
- `id` (String) A synthetic identifier for the stack, equal to the stack name. This value is managed by the provider and cannot be set manually.
- `stack_errors` (Attributes Set) Informational list of errors reported by AWS for the stack. These errors do not affect Terraform lifecycle behavior. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stack_errors))
