# awsappstream_application (Resource)

Manages an AppStream application. An application defines how software is launched on AppStream Elastic fleet streaming instances, including launch configuration, supported platforms, instance families, and application metadata.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# minimal application
resource "awsappstream_application" "example" {
  name = "example-app"

  icon_s3_location {
    s3_bucket = "my-appstream-assets"
    s3_key    = "icons/example.png"
  }

  launch_path = "C:\\Program Files\\ExampleApp\\example.exe"

  platforms = [
    "WINDOWS_SERVER_2019",
  ]

  instance_families = [
    "stream.standard",
  ]

  app_block_arn = "arn:aws:appstream:eu-west-1:123456789012:app-block/example-block"
}
```

```terraform
# full application
resource "awsappstream_application" "example" {
  name         = "example-app"
  display_name = "Example Application"
  description  = "Example AppStream application managed by Terraform"

  icon_s3_location {
    s3_bucket = "my-appstream-assets"
    s3_key    = "icons/example.png"
  }

  launch_path       = "C:\\Program Files\\ExampleApp\\example.exe"
  working_directory = "C:\\Program Files\\ExampleApp"
  launch_parameters = "--mode production"

  platforms = [
    "WINDOWS_SERVER_2019",
    "WINDOWS_SERVER_2022",
  ]

  instance_families = [
    "stream.standard",
    "stream.compute",
  ]

  app_block_arn = "arn:aws:appstream:eu-west-1:123456789012:app-block/example-block"

  tags = {
    Name        = "example-app"
    Environment = "production"
    Owner       = "platform-team"
  }
}
```

- `platforms` (Set of String) The platforms on which the application can run.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The application description, if set. Must be 256 characters or fewer.
- `display_name` (String) The name displayed to users in the AppStream application catalog.
- `launch_parameters` (String) The parameters passed to the application at launch.
- `tags` (Map of String) A map of tags assigned to the AppStream application.
- `working_directory` (String) The working directory of the application.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AppStream application.

### Nested Schema for `icon_s3_location`

Required:

- `s3_bucket` (String) The name of the S3 bucket containing the application icon.
- `s3_key` (String) The S3 object key of the application icon.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:
