## Schema

### Required

- `application_identifier` (String) The identifier of the AppStream application to associate with the entitlement. Changing this value forces the association to be replaced.
- `entitlement_name` (String) The name of the entitlement to which the application is associated. Changing this value forces the association to be replaced.
- `stack_name` (String) The name of the AppStream stack in which the entitlement is defined. Changing this value forces the association to be replaced.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) A synthetic identifier for the association, composed of the stack name, entitlement name, and application identifier. This value is managed by the provider and cannot be set manually.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:
