# awsappstream_app_block (Resource)

Manages an AppStream app block. An app block defines a reusable application package for AppStream Elastic fleets, including application binaries and setup scripts stored in Amazon S3. App blocks can be referenced by multiple AppStream applications.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# minimal app block
resource "awsappstream_app_block" "example" {
  name = "example-app-block"

  source_s3_location {
    s3_bucket = "my-appstream-assets"
    s3_key    = "app-blocks/example/source.zip"
  }

  setup_script_details {
    script_s3_location {
      s3_bucket = "my-appstream-assets"
      s3_key    = "app-blocks/example/setup.ps1"
    }

    executable_path       = "powershell.exe"
    executable_parameters = "-File setup.ps1"
    timeout_in_seconds    = 300
  }
}
```

```terraform
# full app block - CUSTOM packaging
resource "awsappstream_app_block" "example" {
  name         = "example-app-block"
  display_name = "Example App Block"
  description  = "Reusable AppStream app block managed by Terraform"

  packaging_type = "CUSTOM"

  source_s3_location {
    s3_bucket = "my-appstream-assets"
    s3_key    = "app-blocks/example/source.zip"
  }

  setup_script_details {
    script_s3_location {
      s3_bucket = "my-appstream-assets"
      s3_key    = "app-blocks/example/setup.ps1"
    }

    executable_path       = "powershell.exe"
    executable_parameters = "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1"
    timeout_in_seconds    = 600
  }

  tags = {
    Name        = "example-app-block"
    Environment = "production"
    Owner       = "platform-team"
  }
}

# full app block - APPSTREAM2 packaging
resource "awsappstream_app_block" "example" {
  name           = "example-app-block"
  packaging_type = "APPSTREAM2"

  source_s3_location {
    s3_bucket = "my-appstream-assets"
    # s3_key optional when AppStream builds a new package
  }

  post_setup_script_details {
    script_s3_location {
      s3_bucket = "my-appstream-assets"
      s3_key    = "app-blocks/example/post-setup.ps1"
    }

    executable_path       = "powershell.exe"
    executable_parameters = "-File post-setup.ps1"
    timeout_in_seconds    = 300
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the AppStream app block. Changing this value forces the app block to be replaced.
- `source_s3_location` (Attributes) Specifies the Amazon S3 location that contains the app block source. Depending on the packaging type, this can be an application package (VHD) or source content used to build the app block. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source_s3_location))

### Optional

- `description` (String) The AppStream app block description, if set. Must be 256 characters or fewer.
- `display_name` (String) The display name of the AppStream app block.
- `packaging_type` (String) The packaging type of the app block. Valid values are `CUSTOM` or `APPSTREAM2`.
- `post_setup_script_details` (Attributes) Specifies a post-setup script that is executed after the app block is created. This configuration is supported only for app blocks with the `APPSTREAM2` packaging type. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--post_setup_script_details))
- `setup_script_details` (Attributes) Specifies the setup script that is executed when the app block is built. This configuration is required for app blocks with the `CUSTOM` packaging type. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--setup_script_details))
- `tags` (Map of String) A map of tags assigned to the AppStream app block.

### Read-Only

- `app_block_errors` (Attributes Set) Informational list of errors reported by AWS for the app block. These errors do not affect Terraform lifecycle behavior. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--app_block_errors))
- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AppStream app block.
- `created_time` (String) The timestamp when the app block was created, in RFC 3339 format.
- `id` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AppStream app block. This value is managed by the provider and cannot be set manually.
- `state` (String) The state of the AppStream app block.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
