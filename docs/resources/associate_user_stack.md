# awsappstream_associate_user_stack (Resource)

Manages the association between an AppStream user and an AppStream stack. This resource represents the relationship only and does not create or manage the underlying user or stack.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "awsappstream_associate_user_stack" "example" {
  stack_name          = "example-stack"
  user_name           = "example@example.com"
  authentication_type = "USERPOOL"

  send_email_notification = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `authentication_type` (String) The authentication type used by the user. Changing this value forces the association to be replaced. Valid values are `API`, `SAML`, `USERPOOL`, or `AWS_AD`.
- `stack_name` (String) The name of the AppStream stack to associate with the user. Changing this value forces the association to be replaced.
- `user_name` (String) The email address of the AppStream user to associate with the stack. Email addresses are **case-sensitive**. Changing this value forces the association to be replaced.

### Optional

- `send_email_notification` (Boolean) Specifies whether a welcome email is sent to the user after the association is created. This option is only applicable when `authentication_type` is `USERPOOL`. For other authentication types, the user must already exist and this value is ignored. Changing this value forces the association to be replaced.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) A synthetic identifier for the association, composed of the stack name, authentication type, and user name. This value is managed by the provider and cannot be set manually.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import awsappstream_associate_user_stack.example "example-stack|USERPOOL|example@example.com"
```
