## Schema

### Required

- `application_arn` (String) The ARN of the AppStream application to associate with the fleet. Changing this value forces the association to be replaced.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) A synthetic identifier for the association, composed of the fleet name and application ARN. This value is managed by the provider and cannot be set manually.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:
