# awsappstream_entitlement (Resource)

Manages an AppStream entitlement within a specific AppStream stack. Entitlements define which users (based on AWS IAM SAML PrincipalTag attributes) can see and launch applications from a stack.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "awsappstream_entitlement" "example" {
  stack_name     = "example-stack"
  name           = "example-name"
  description    = "Example entitlement managed by Terraform."
  app_visibility = "ALL"

  attributes = [
    {
      name  = "roles"
      value = "admin"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_visibility` (String) Controls which applications are visible to users who match the entitlement attributes. Valid values are `ALL` or `ASSOCIATED`.
- `attributes` (Attributes Set) One or more attribute rules used to match federated user attributes (AWS IAM SAML PrincipalTag). Each entry specifies a supported attribute name and the value that must be present for a user session. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--attributes))
- `name` (String) The name of the entitlement within the stack. Changing this value forces the entitlement to be replaced.
- `stack_name` (String) The name of the AppStream stack in which the entitlement is defined. Changing this value forces the entitlement to be replaced.

### Optional

- `description` (String) An optional description for the entitlement. Must be 256 characters or fewer.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) A synthetic identifier for the entitlement, composed of the stack name and entitlement name. This value is managed by the provider and cannot be set manually.

<a id="nestedatt--attributes"></a>
### Nested Schema for `attributes`

Required:

- `name` (String) A supported AWS IAM SAML PrincipalTag attribute name. Valid values are: `roles`, `department`, `organization`, `groups`, `title`, `costCenter`, `userType`.
- `value` (String) The value of the selected attribute name that must match the federated user session. Must be at least 1 character.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import awsappstream_entitlement.example "example-stack|example-name"
```
