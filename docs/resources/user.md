# awsappstream_user (Resource)

Manages an AppStream user. An AppStream user represents an identity that can authenticate to AppStream using a specific authentication type. Users can be enabled or disabled and are associated with exactly one authentication type.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# minimal user
resource "awsappstream_user" "minimal" {
  authentication_type = "USERPOOL"
  user_name           = "example@example.com"
}
```

```terraform
# full user
resource "awsappstream_user" "full" {
  authentication_type = "USERPOOL"
  user_name           = "example@example.com"

  first_name = "Example"
  last_name  = "User"

  # Write-only, applies only at creation
  message_action = "SUPPRESS"

  # Explicitly manage enabled state
  enabled = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `authentication_type` (String) The authentication type used by the user. Changing this value forces the user to be replaced. Valid values are `API`, `SAML`, `USERPOOL`, or `AWS_AD`.
- `user_name` (String) The email address of the AppStream user. Email addresses are **case-sensitive** and must exactly match during login. Changing this value forces the user to be replaced.

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether the user is enabled. Defaults to `true` if not explicitly set. Disabling a user prevents login without deleting the user.
- `first_name` (String) The first (given) name of the user.
- `last_name` (String) The last (family) name of the user.
- `message_action` (String) Controls the welcome email sent to the user when the user is created. This setting is **write-only** and applies only during creation. Valid values are `SUPPRESS` or `RESEND`. Changing this value forces the user to be replaced.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AppStream user.
- `created_time` (String) The timestamp when the user was created, in RFC 3339 format.
- `id` (String) A synthetic identifier for the user, composed of the authentication type and user name. This value is managed by the provider and cannot be set manually.
- `status` (String) The status of the user as reported by AWS. This attribute is informational and cannot be modified.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```
