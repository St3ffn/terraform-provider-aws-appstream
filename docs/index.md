# AWS AppStream Provider

The **awsappstream** provider allows you to manage AWS AppStream resources
using Terraform.

Authentication and region selection follow the standard AWS SDK behavior.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# minimal provider configuration
provider "awsappstream" {
  region = "eu-central-1" # required
}
```

```terraform
# full provider configuration
provider "awsappstream" {
  profile            = "aws-test-account-profile"
  region             = "eu-central-1" # required
  retry_max_attempts = 10
  retry_max_backoff  = 30
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `region` (String) The AWS region in which AppStream resources are managed. This value must be set explicitly and cannot be unknown at plan time.

### Optional

- `profile` (String) The name of the AWS CLI profile to use. If not set, the AWS SDK default credential resolution chain is used (environment variables, shared credentials file, EC2/ECS metadata, etc.).
- `retry_max_attempts` (Number) The maximum number of retry attempts for AWS AppStream API calls. This controls how many times a failed request is retried before returning an error. **Default:** 3
- `retry_max_backoff` (Number) The maximum backoff time, in seconds, between retry attempts for AWS AppStream API calls. This value limits the exponential backoff applied by the AWS SDK. **Default:** 20 seconds
